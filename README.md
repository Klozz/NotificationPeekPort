#### Google+ Community
I have published the app on Google Play through Beta channel, feel free to join the **[community](https://plus.google.com/communities/115556559938393378451)** to get the latest version.

#### What it does
Notification Peek (Paranoid Android) is a nice feature for displaying notifications on your screen when they arrive. It uses the device's gyroscope and/or proximity sensors to detect the status of the device and display the notifications in a minimalistic UI for a short time.

#### What I did
* Removed several system APIs, and replaced them with public APIs.
* UI tweaks, changed LinearLayout to GridLayout for displaying large numbers of unread notifications.
* Added notification peek timeout option.
* Added an option to choose which sensors are monitored when a notification arrives.
* Added a methodology for dismissing notifications and locking the screen upon dismissing the final notification.

#### How to uninstall
Because the Device Administrator disables apps that is activated from being uninstalled, you need to do the following if you want to uninstall the app:
* Go to your System Settings.
* Select **Security**.
* Select **Device administrators**.
* Uncheck Peek.
* Now you can uninstall the app.

#### What is missing
* A lot of great features.

#### Known issue
* Compatibility issue with Whatsapp.
